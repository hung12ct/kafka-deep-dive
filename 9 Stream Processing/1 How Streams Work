EVENT TIME : This is the time the events we are tracking occurred and the record was createdâ€”
the time a measurement was taken, an item at was sold at a shop, a user viewed a
page on our website, etc.
LOG APPEND TIME : This is the time the event arrived to the Kafka broker and was stored there
PROCESSING TIME : This is the time at which a stream-processing application received the event in
order to perform some calculation. This time can be milliseconds, hours, or days
after the event occurred
WHEN TRACKING JUST THE EVENTS IS NOT ENOUGH - MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE
(i.e. type, moving average, etc)
SOLUTION:
capture metadata like type/hour
events that require joining
sum, averages
store all of this in STATE!
TWO TYPE OF STATE
LOCAL - VERY FAST
EXTERNAL - (i.e. CASSANDRA DB)
Unlimited size, access from diff apps
but latency issues
STREAMS - keep a history of changes
NO DELETE
convert table to stream
turn INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE into stream
convert streams to table
